Hackathon Idea – AI Personal Finance Assistant for Micro-Businesses

**AI-powered Personal Finance Assistant** for **micro-businesses** (like small shops, freelancers, and teams with 1–10 people). These small businesses usually don’t have accountants or fancy tools, so handling money becomes stressful. Our AI assistant helps them manage finances easily, without needing to understand complex accounting.
